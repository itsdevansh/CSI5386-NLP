## Setup and Execution Guide

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### For Windows:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

#### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have `pip` installed and updated, then install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Part1.py
Execute the first script using Python:
```bash
python Part1.py
```

### 4. Run Assignment1_part2.ipynb
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Assignment1_part2.ipynb
```
Then, execute the cells as required.

### Notes:
- Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, install it using:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```
- Activate the virtual environment before running any scripts.
- If there are any missing dependencies, install them using `pip install <package_name>`.
