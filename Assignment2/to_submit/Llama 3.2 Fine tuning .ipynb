Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.\\n This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.  Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now.  For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for. \\nIn conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home. \",\n          \" The use of cell phones while driving is a dangerous and potentially deadly habit that has become all too common in the American public. Despite the known risks and consequences, many people continue to engage in this distracting behavior, putting themselves and others on the road at risk of accident and injury.\\n\\nRecent studies have shown that cell phone use while driving is a major contributing factor to distracted driving, which is responsible for thousands of accidents and hundreds of deaths each year. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving claimed the lives of 3,142 people in 2019 alone.\\n\\nThere are several ways in which cell phone use can distract a driver and increase the risk of an accident. One of the most common is known as visual distraction, which occurs when a driver takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone. This can happen when reading a text message, checking a notification, or even just looking at the phone screen to see who is calling. Another type of distraction is manual distraction, which happens when a driver takes their hands off the wheel to handle their phone, such as when texting or dialing a number. Finally, cognitive distraction occurs when a driver's attention is focused on their phone instead of the road, even if their eyes are on the wheel and their hands are on the wheel. A driver who is distracted by their cell phone may not be aware of upcoming stops, changing traffic patterns, or other hazards on the road.\\n\\nIn addition to the dangers of distracted driving, cell phone use while driving can also lead to other reckless behaviors. For example, a driver who is distracted by their phone may fail to notice that they are going over the speed limit or fail to stop at a red light. This can result in costly penalties and consequences for the driver, including fines, citations, and increased insurance rates. In some cases, distracted driving may even result in criminal charges, especially if it leads to injury or death.\\n\\nTo combat the dangers of cell phone use while driving, many states have implemented laws to restrict their use behind the wheel. For example, some states have banned handheld cell phone use while driving, requiring drivers to use hands-free devices if they need to make a call or send a message. Others have banned texting while driving altogether, regardless of whether the driver is using a hands-free device. These laws are designed to increase public safety and reduce the number of accidents and injuries caused by distracted driving. \\n\\nDespite these laws and the known risks of cell phone use while driving, many people continue to engage in this dangerous behavior. To reduce cell phone use while driving and increase public safety, it is important to increase awareness of the risks and consequences of distracted driving. This can be done through educational campaigns, reminders of the legal penalties for distracted driving, and advocating for further legislation to restrict cell phone use behind the wheel. By taking these steps, we can work towards making the roads safer for everyone and preventing accidents and injuries caused by distracted driving. \\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phone use while driving is a dangerous and potentially deadly habit that puts the safety of the American public at risk. By increasing awareness of the dangers of distracted driving and implementing laws to restrict cell phone use behind the wheel, we can work towards reducing accidents and injuries caused by this behavior. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with each individual driver to prioritize safety and avoid any distractions while operating a vehicle. \\n\\nWould you like help with another problem statement? \",\n          \"Have you ever just wondered if there could be life somewhere else from earth?\\n\\nIf so then how about the face that they found on mars. Many people dont agree that it's just landform that built it's self up and just happened to resembul a face. Others would disagree and say that it is just land and that shodows were the main purpose of the enitre thing that made it look like a face. Why did the face on mars not look the same in 1976 i looked like a smilly face at first.  When the picuture was taken it was taken in many different angles. That shows that there is a posability that the picture that they took at the time was in a way that made it have shadows an some sides.  The camara that took it could have been faceing in the direction that the sun was shining and got some of the light make shadows on the landform.\\n\\nThe scientist that looked at the picture taken by Viking 1 says it was only landform shaped in different ways. Makeing it appear like something that is not really there. Garvin says that it remindes him of a lava dome around the America West it's about the same height as the face that they found on mars.  When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in. And in 2001 is when started to shape into something over the years in changed and over more years it will change even more.  After that and so on because that's just what landforms do they change but, you can't always see the same thing you sole once. \\n I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone  But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life.  that object that was found on mars is only land built up that looks some what like a face and not a statue or remains of a living person or creature. but something that was a different landform a long time ago before it became what is know as the face on mars. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 9893,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 34271,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 34272,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6194,\n          16004,\n          21655\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

              "\" If you're a photographer, keep all the necessary lens, cords, and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio. Paints should be kept with brushes, cleaner, and canvas, print supplies should be by the ink, etc. Make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier, limiting your search to a much smaller area. Some ideas include:\\n\\n\\nEssential supplies area -- the things you use every day.\\nInspiration and reference area.\\nDedicated work area .\\nInfrequent or secondary supplies area, tucked out of the way.;\\n, This doesn't mean cleaning the entire studio, it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk, easel, pottery wheel, etc. clean each night. Discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces. Endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately, without having to do any work or tidying.\\n\\n\\nEven if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized, an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art.\\n\\n, As visual people, a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight. By using jars, old glasses, vases, and cheap, clear plastic drawers, you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly. Some ideas, beyond those just mentioned, include:\\n\\n\\nCanvas shoe racks on the back of the door\\nWine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens/pencils.\\nPlastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint, pigment, etc., Simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don't want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape. Cheap and easy, this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration., Shelving is an artist's best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space. Don't be afraid to get up high either, especially for infrequently used supplies. The upper reaches of the room are often the most under-utilized, but provide vital space for all your tools and materials., Turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas, sketches, and planning without requiring extra equipment or space. You can even use it for smaller areas. Paint over jars or storage equipment, allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change.\\n\\n, A lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things, trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently. This usually has the opposite effect, leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning, but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything. Instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things, you can just follow the labels, freeing your mind to think about art., Once a month, do a purge of your studio. If it isn't essential or part of a project, either throw it out or file it away for later. Artists are constantly making new things, experimenting, and making a mess. This is a good thing, but only if you set aside time to declutter. It may not be fun at the moment, but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch.\\n\\n\\nDon't be sentimental here. If you haven't used it in the last six months there is little chance you'll use it in the next six months. Toss it.\\n\\n\""

Fixing it is easier than you might think. By following a few simple steps, you can have your window looking like new in no time.\\n\\nStep 1: Determine what kind of window or door you\\'re dealing with\\n\\nBefore you start fixing the window or door, you need to determine what kind of glass you\\'ll need to use. Check your local building codes to see if tempered glass is required for storm windows and doors. If not, you may be able to use regular pane glass for inside (not storm) windows and doors.\\n\\nStep 2: Remove the window from the casing if possible\\n\\nIf the broken window is in a wooden frame, you may be able to remove the whole window from the casing. If the window is in a door, you\\'ll need to take the door off the hinges. This will make it easier to work on the window.\\n\\nStep 3: Dispose of the broken glass\\n\\nBefore you can start repairing the window, you\\'ll need to dispose of the broken glass. Be sure to wear gloves and use caution when handling broken glass.\\n\\nStep 4: Remove any remaining old caulk with the putty knife\\n\\nUse a putty knife to remove any old caulk around the window frame. This will help the new glass fit properly into the frame.\\n\\nStep 5: Carefully measure the width and length of the opening for the window\\n\\nMeasure the width and length of the window opening carefully. This will ensure that the new glass fits properly in the frame.\\n\\nStep 6: Go to your friendly neighborhood hardware store or home center and have them cut the glass\\n\\nTake the measurements to your local hardware store or home center and have them cut the glass to size.\\n\\nStep 7: Insert the glass into the frame\\n\\nCarefully insert the new glass into the frame. Be sure to wear gloves and use caution when handling the glass.\\n\\nStep 8: Find the spots where the old glazier points were and put in new ones\\n\\nGlazier points hold the glass in place. Find the spots where the old glazier points were and put in new ones to secure the glass in the frame.\\n\\nStep 9: Prepare the glazing compound\\n\\nGlazing compound is used to seal the gaps between the glass and the frame. Prepare the compound according to the instructions on the package.\\n\\nStep 10: Using the flat edge of the glaziers tool or putty knife, scoop off a section of putty from your hand and spread it into the \"shelf\" area at any point; best not to start in a corner.\\n\\nUsing a glaziers tool or putty knife, scoop off a section of putty from your hand and spread it onto the frame. Start in the middle of a side and work your way towards the corners.\\n\\nStep 11: Corners\\n\\nWhen you get to the corners, fold the putty over itself and press it into place. Repeat this process for each side.\\n\\nStep 12: Once you\\'ve finished caulking the window, allow it to cure at least a day before cleaning up any spillage on the glass\\n\\nLet the window sit untouched for at least a day to give the glazing compound time to cure. After that, you can clean up any spillage on the glass with a razor blade or window scraper.\\n\\nStep 13: Congratulations!\\n\\nCongratulations! You\\'ve successfully fixed your broken window in a wooden frame. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the view.\\n\\nClassification:',\n",

Provide your answer in the format: \\'Classification: [LLM/Human]\\'.\\n\\nText:\\nHow to Fix a Broken Window in a Wooden Frame\\n\\nIf you have a broken window in a wooden frame, don\\'t panic! Fixing it is easier than you might think. By following a few simple steps, you can have your window looking like new in no time.\\n\\nStep 1: Determine what kind of window or door you\\'re dealing with\\n\\nBefore you start fixing the window or door, you need to determine what kind of glass you\\'ll need to use. Check your local building codes to see if tempered glass is required for storm windows and doors. If not, you may be able to use regular pane glass for inside (not storm) windows and doors.\\n\\nStep 2: Remove the window from the casing if possible\\n\\nIf the broken window is in a wooden frame, you may be able to remove the whole window from the casing. If the window is in a door, you\\'ll need to take the door off the hinges. This will make it easier to work on the window.\\n\\nStep 3: Dispose of the broken glass\\n\\nBefore you can start repairing the window, you\\'ll need to dispose of the broken glass. Be sure to wear gloves and use caution when handling broken glass.\\n\\nStep 4: Remove any remaining old caulk with the putty knife\\n\\nUse a putty knife to remove any old caulk around the window frame. This will help the new glass fit properly into the frame.\\n\\nStep 5: Carefully measure the width and length of the opening for the window\\n\\nMeasure the width and length of the window opening carefully. This will ensure that the new glass fits properly in the frame.\\n\\nStep 6: Go to your friendly neighborhood hardware store or home center and have them cut the glass\\n\\nTake the measurements to your local hardware store or home center and have them cut the glass to size.\\n\\nStep 7: Insert the glass into the frame\\n\\nCarefully insert the new glass into the frame. Be sure to wear gloves and use caution when handling the glass.\\n\\nStep 8: Find the spots where the old glazier points were and put in new ones\\n\\nGlazier points hold the glass in place. Find the spots where the old glazier points were and put in new ones to secure the glass in the frame.\\n\\nStep 9: Prepare the glazing compound\\n\\nGlazing compound is used to seal the gaps between the glass and the frame. Prepare the compound according to the instructions on the package.\\n\\nStep 10: Using the flat edge of the glaziers tool or putty knife, scoop off a section of putty from your hand and spread it into the \"shelf\" area at any point; best not to start in a corner.\\n\\nUsing a glaziers tool or putty knife, scoop off a section of putty from your hand and spread it onto the frame. Start in the middle of a side and work your way towards the corners.\\n\\nStep 11: Corners\\n\\nWhen you get to the corners, fold the putty over itself and press it into place. Repeat this process for each side.\\n\\nStep 12: Once you\\'ve finished caulking the window, allow it to cure at least a day before cleaning up any spillage on the glass\\n\\nLet the window sit untouched for at least a day to give the glazing compound time to cure. After that, you can clean up any spillage on the glass with a razor blade or window scraper.\\n\\nStep 13: Congratulations!\\n\\nCongratulations! You\\'ve successfully fixed your broken window in a wooden frame. Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the view.\\n\\nClassification:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nLLM<|eot_id|>'"
